	\begin{abstract}
		In this paper, we solve the well-known symbolic regression problem. This problem has been intensively studied in the literature and has a wide range of applications. The symbolic regression models could provide insights towards establishing physical theory behind experimentally observed data. Practical applications include revealing complex ecological dynamics in ecology, discovering mutations effects on protein stability in biology, modeling analytic representations of the exciton binding energy in energy science, finding models for band gaps of NaCl-type compounds
		in material science, just to name a few. 
		
		We propose a new meta-heuristic-based approach, called \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} to solve this problem. \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} is based on the following elements: ($i$) iterated local search is the method backbone, mainly solving combinatorial and some continuous aspects of the problem; ($ii$) ordinary least square method is focused on the continuous aspect of the search space -- it efficiently determines the best--fitting coefficients of linear combinations within solution equations;  ($iii$) a novel fitness function combines three important model quality measures: $R^2$ score, RMSE score, and the size of the model (or model complexity). 
		
		The experiments are conducted on the two well-known ground-truth benchmark sets called \textsc{Feynman} and \textsc{Strogatz}. \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} was compared to 14 other competitors from the literature with  presence of different levels of the Gaussian white noise in the input data. Our method outperformed all 14 competitors with respect to the true symbolic model accuracy percentage under all level of noise. 
		In addition to evaluation on known ground-truth datasets, a new randomly generated set of problem instances is introduced. The goal of \textsc{Random} dataset was to test the scalability of our method with respect to incremental equation sizes and different levels of noise. \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} can be considered as a new state-of-the-art method for solving the problem of symbolic regression when ground-truth equations are known.

	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
	
	The problem of symbolic regression (SR)~\cite{billard2002symbolic} has attracted many researchers over the last decade. SR can be seen as a generalization of more specific variants of regression in which the functional form is fixed, e.g. the well-known linear regression, polynomial regression~\cite{stimson1978interpreting}, etc. All regression models have the same goal: given a set of $n$-dimensional input data and its corresponding continuous output target variable, the aim is to find a  mathematical expression (function) of $n$ (input) variables that best \emph{fits} the target variable.  %This computationally intensive task is in general provenly NP--hard~\cite{virgolin2022symbolic}. 
	In the case of linear regression, the model is always a linear combination of input variables. This is in general not good enough, since target variable might be dependent on some nonlinear function among input variables. Unlike linear regression, SR allows the search over much larger space of possible mathematical formulas to find the best-fitting ones, i.e. those able to predict the target variable from the input variables. The basis of constructing explicit formula is in elementary operations like addition and multiplication, as well as polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and others.  
	%Application: https://towardsdatascience.com/real-world-applications-of-symbolic-regression-2025d17b88ef
	
	SR models tend to be interpretable, unlike artificial neural networks. Coefficients inside SR formulas might indicate the absolute or relative importance of certain input variables. Moreover, relations among variables might be described in an elegant way. For example, the appearance of an exponential function can be associated with some physical phenomenon such as the intensity of radiation or acceleration over time, see~\cite{udrescu2020ai}. Additionally, the SR models often have high generalization power unlike some models with fixed functional forms such as polynomial regression. 
	
	Practical applications of SR in chemical and biological sciences are listed in~\cite{weng2020simple}. In particular, this paper describes the discovery of a series of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved activities. The application of SR to discovering physical laws from a distorted video is studied in~\cite{udrescu2021symbolic}. Revealing complex ecological dynamics by SR is presented in~\cite{chen2019revealing}. Paper \cite{louis2021reviewing} shows how SR is used to model the effects of the mutations on protein stability, in the domain of fundamental and applied biology. One recent study \cite{liu2021machine} is concerned of auto-discovering conserved quantities using trajectory data from unknown dynamical systems. Paper~\cite{liang2019phillips} shows the application of SR to model analytic representations of the exciton binding energy. The use of SR in material science is described in~\cite{wang2019symbolic,wang2022symbolic,burlacu2022symbolic,kabliman2021application}. SR application to wind speed forecasting is given in~\cite{abdellaoui2021symbolic}. 
	
	There are many different ways to tackle the SR. Most of them are based on the machine learning techniques, genetic programming (GP) or some other meta-heuristics. Among the first GP methods to tackle SR is the one of Raidl~\cite{raidl1998hybrid} based on a hybrid variant of genetic programming. A differential evolution algorithm was proposed by Cerny et al.~\cite{cerny2008using}. Age-fitness Pareto Optimization approach is proposed by Smidt and Lipson~\cite{schmidt2010age}.  Application of the artificial bee colony programming to solve SR is proposed by Karaboga et al.~\cite{karaboga2012artificial}. 
	Application of local-based heuristics for solving SR is reported by Commenda in his PhD thesis~\cite{kommenda2018local}. A GP-based approach, the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm (\textsc{GOMEA}) is studied by Virgolin et al.~\cite{virgolin2021improving}.  Another evolutionary algorithm, the interaction-transformation EA (\textsc{ITEA}) has been proposed by de Franca et al.~\cite{de2021interaction}. Simulated annealing to solve SR is proposed by Kantor~\cite{kantor2021simulated}. A variable neighbourhood programming approach to solve SR  is proposed by Elleurich et al.~\cite{elleuch2020variable}; this technique is initially proposed in~\cite{elleuch2016variable}. 
	Kommenda et al.~\cite{kommenda2020parameter} proposed a method called \textsc{Operon} algorithm, which uses nonlinear least squares for parameter identification of SR models further integrated into a local search mechanism in tree-based GP. The C++ implementation of \textsc{Operon} is discussed in~\cite{burlacu2020operon}. The method that utilizes the Taylor polynomials to approximate the symbolic equation that fits the dataset, called Taylor genetic programming, is proposed in~\cite{he2022taylor}. A GP approach that uses the idea of semantic back-propagation (Sbp-Gp) is proposed in~\cite{virgolin2019linear}.  Empirical analysis of variance between many GP-based methods for SR is discussed in~\cite{kammerer2021empirical}. It is also worth to mention the GP-based Eurequa commercial solver~\cite{schmidt2009distilling, schmidt2011machine} that uses age-fitness pareto optimization with co-evolved fitness estimation. This solver is nowadays accepted as the gold standard of symbolic regression.   
	
	Method based on Bayesian symbolic regression (\textsc{BSR}) is proposed in~\cite{jin2019bayesian} -- this method belongs to a family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC). Deep Symbolic Regression (\textsc{DSR}), an RNN approach, is proposed in~\cite{petersen2019deep} -- it utilizes the policy gradient search. This mechanism of search is further investigated in~\cite{landajuela2021improving}. A fast neural network approach, called \textsc{OccamNet},  is proposed in~\cite{costa2020fast}.  A deep reinforcement learning approach enhanced with genetic programming is proposed in~\cite{mundhenk2021symbolic}. 
	
    Powerful hybrid techniques to solve SR are also well studied; among them, we emphasize the \textsc{Eplex} solver from~\cite{la2019probabilistic,la2016epsilon} and \textsc{AI Feynman} algorithm from~\cite{udrescu2020ai}, a physics-inspired divide-and-conquer method combined with the neural network fitting. The latter is one of the most efficient methods for physically-inspired models. We also mention the Fast Function Extraction (\textsc{FFX}) algorithm developed by McConaghy~\cite{mcconaghy2011ffx}, which is a non-evolutionary method combined with a machine learning technique called path-wise-regularized learning, which quickly prunes a huge set of candidate basis functions down to compact models.
	
	A short overview of the most important literature methods to solve SR is given in Table~\ref{tab:gp-based}.

   The SR researches lack uniform, robust, and transparent
	benchmarking standards. Recently, La Cava et al.~\cite{la2021contemporary} proposed an
	open-source, reproducible benchmarking platform for SR, called SRBench. The authors extended  PMLB~\cite{olson2017pmlb},  a repository of standardized regression problems, with 130 SR datasets for which exact (\emph{ground-truth}) models are known; see more in the aforementioned paper. In their extensive experimental evaluation, 14
	symbolic regression methods and 7 machine learning methods are compared on the set of 252 diverse regression problems. The remaining 122 SR datasets belong to a class of so-called \emph{black-box} problems for which the \emph{ground-truth} is unknown. One of the most interesting conclusions from La Cava et al. research is that algorithms specialize in either solving \emph{ground-truth} problems, or \emph{black-box} problems, but not both. 
	
	In this work we present a novel approach to solve \emph{ground-truth}-based SR, which combines the popular iterated local search meta-heuristic (ILS)~\cite{lourencco2003iterated,lourencco2019iterated} with the ordinary least square method (OLS)~\cite{leng2007ordinary}. ILS mostly handles combinatorial (discrete) aspects of search space, while OLS helps in the process of a coefficient determination, so it handles some continuous parts of the search space. As will be shown later, the proposed method has shown its robustness w.r.t. introduced noise, therefore we called the method \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  (with letters R corresponding to regression and robust). Additionally, in order to navigate the search toward exact model (and not only accurate one) the algorithm is equipped with a carefully constructed fitness function that utilizes three important model characteristics: RMSE and $R^2$ scores which participate into models accuracy, and a weighted solution size that penalizies too complex models. 
	
	The summary of main contributions is as follows: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The proposed method outperforms 14 comparison methods on two \emph{ground-truth} benchmark sets from literature -- these methods and benchmarks are used in SRBench platform.  
		
		\item The method shows its high robustness, which is proved by its comparison to the other algorithms in the presence of different levels of Gaussian white noise in the input data. 
		
		\item The method is very efficient, taking in average less than 4 minutes to reach the exact solution, on the problem instances where it was possible. 
		
		\item A new set of unbiased instances is introduced -- it consists of randomly generated formulae of various sizes and number of input variables. This set was employed to analyze the effect of the model size and the level of noise on the solving difficulty. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\section{Problem definition and search space}
	\label{sec:search-space}
	In this section we formally define the SR problem.
	
	\begin{definition}
		Given is a dataset $D = \{(\mathbf{x_i}, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\mathbf{x_i} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represents i-th feature (input) vector while $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is its corresponding target (output) variable. Suppose that there exists an analytical model of the form $f(\mathbf{x})= g^*(\mathbf{x}, \theta^*) + \epsilon $ that is a generator of all observations from $D$.  
		The goal of SR is to learn a mapping $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{x})=  \tilde{g}(\mathbf{x}, \tilde{\theta})  \colon \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$  estimated by searching through the space of (mathematical) expressions  $\tilde{g}$ and parameters $\tilde{\theta}$ where  $\epsilon$ is observed white noise within the given input data. 
		
	\end{definition}
	
	Koza~\cite{koza1994genetic} introduced the problem of SR as a specific application of genetic programming. GP can be used to optimize nonlinear structures such as computer programs. In particular, the programs are represented by syntax trees consisting of functions/operations over input features and constants. As an example of a function represented by a syntax tree, see Figure~\ref{fig:syntax-tree-example}. In essence, all valid syntax trees form the solution search space of SR. That is, each sample model $\tilde{f}$ may be seen as a point in the search space, represented by respective syntax tree. The solution accuracy can be computed on the basis of historical data $D$ and the chosen error measure such as $MSE$, $RMSE$, $R^2$, some combination of them, etc. Interestingly, the SR search space nature is twofold: discrete and continuous. It is primarily modeled as a problem of discrete (combinatorial) optimization, since the number of possible solution functional forms is countable. However, it may also include elements solved by means of continuous (global) optimization, e.g., constants (coefficients) fitting. It is common to use the set of the following elementary mathematical functions: $\sqrt{x}, x^2 $, $\sin$, $\cos$, $\log$, $\exp$, $\arcsin$, $\arccos$, $a^x$, and a set of standard arithmetic operators: $+$, $-$, $\cdot$, and $/$.

	\section{The proposed method}\label{sec:rils}
 
	Before we give details on our \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  method for solving SR, we will explain two building blocks of \textsc{RILS-ROLS}: 1) iterated local search (ILS) and 2) ordinary least squares (OLS). 
	
	\subsection{Iterated local search}
	ILS~\cite{lourencco2003iterated} is an efficient meta-heuristics that iteratively generates a sequence of solutions produced by the (embedded) heuristic, such as local search (LS) or randomized greedy heuristics. When the search gets \emph{stuck} in local optimum, a \emph{perturbation} is performed -- this step is usually non-deterministic. This simple idea was proposed by Baxter~\cite{baxter1981local} in early 1980s, and, since then, has been  re-invented by many researches under different names. Some of the following names were used: iterated descent search~\cite{baum1998iterated}, large-step
	Markov chains~\cite{martin1991large}, chained local optimization~\cite{martin1996combining}, or, in some cases, combinations of previous~\cite{applegate2003chained}. The most popular version of ILS is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:ils}. (Note that we use this version of ILS as the backbone of our \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} algorithm.)
	
	\begin{algorithm}
		\begin{algorithmic}[1] 
			\State \textbf{Input}: problem instance
			\State \textbf{Output}: feasible solution 
			\State $s \gets$ \texttt{Initialize}$()$
			\State  $s \gets$ \texttt{LocalSearch}($s$)
			\While{\emph{stopping criteria are not met}}
			\State  $s' \gets$ \texttt{Perturbation}($s$)
			\State  $s' \gets$ \texttt{LocalSearch}($s'$)
			\State  $ s \gets$ \texttt{AcceptanceCriterion}($s, s'$)
			\EndWhile
			\State \Return $s$
		\end{algorithmic}
		\caption{General ILS method.}
		\label{alg:ils}
	\end{algorithm}  
	
	An initial solution may be generated randomly or by using a greedy heuristic, which is afterwards, improved by local search. At each iteration, ILS applies three steps. First, the current incumbent solution $s$ is perturbed -- it is partially randomized, yielding new solution $s'$. Next, the solution $s'$ is potentially improved by a LS procedure. Thirdly, the newly obtained solution $s'$  possibly becomes new incumbent -- this is decided upon the acceptance criterion. Sometimes, ILS incorporates a mechanism of tabu list, which prevents the search getting back into already visited solutions.  		 
	
	\subsection{Ordinary least square method}\label{sec:ols}
	Ordinary least square method (OLS) is a linear regression technique. It is based on applying the least-square method to minimize the square residual (error) sum  between actual and predicted values (given by the model). More precisely, given previously introduced dataset $D$ of $n$ points $(\mathbf{x_i}, y_i)$ where each $\mathbf{x_i}$ is $d$-dimensional, the task is to determine linear mapping $\tilde{y} = \mathbf{k} \mathbf{x} + b$, that is coefficients (line slope) $\mathbf{k} = (k_1, \ldots, k_d)$ and $b$ (intercept), so that $ \sum_{i}^{n} (\tilde{y}_i - y_i)^2 $ is minimized. This sum is also know as the sum of squared errors (SSE). There are many methods to minimize SSE. One of the analytical approaches is the calculus-oriented -- it takes into account partial derivatives of SSE w.r.t. $k_j,\; j \in \{1, ..., d\}$: 
	
	$$  \frac{\partial}{\partial k_j} \sum_{i}^{n} (\tilde{y}_i - y_i)^2 = \frac{\partial}{\partial k_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \mathbf{k}\mathbf{x_i}+b  - y_i)^2 =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2x_{ij}(\mathbf{k}\mathbf{x_i} + b - y_i).$$
  
	Similarly, by taking into account  partial derivation w.r.t. $b$, we have: 
	$$  \frac{\partial}{\partial b} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\tilde{y}_i - y_i)^2  = \frac{\partial}{\partial b} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( \mathbf{k}\mathbf{x_i}+b  - y_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} -2  (y_i - \tilde{y}_i). $$
	
	Finally, by setting each partial derivative to zero, we get the system of $d+1$ equations with $d+1$ unknowns ($\mathbf{k}=(k_1, ..., k_d)$ and $b$): 
	\begin{align*}
		& \sum_{i=1}^{n} -2x_{i1} (y_i - \tilde{y}_i) = 0 \\
		& \vdots \\
		& \sum_{i=1}^{n} -2x_{id} (y_i - \tilde{y}_i) = 0 \\
		&\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2  (y_i - \tilde{y}_i) = 0.
	\end{align*}
	%The above system can be transformed to 
	%\begin{align*}
	%	 & \sum y_i \cdot x_i   = b\sum x_i \cdot x_i  +  k \cdot \sum x_i \\
	%	 & \sum y_i  = k \sum x_i + b \cdot d. 
	%  \end{align*}

To solve a linear system of $(d+1)$ unknowns and $d+1$ linear equations involved,  Cholesky  factorization or LU decomposition for matrix inversion, and Winograd or Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication depending on a solver of linear equations chosen as well as the sparsity of the matrix associated to the linear system~\cite{krishnamoorthy2013matrix}. For example, by using Cholesky decomposition, solving the system requires a matrix inversions and matrix multiplications;  computation cost of $d^3$ is required to find an inverse of the matrix associated to the linear system, which is the most consuming part of the algorithm. Thus, OLS using close-form matrix techniques performs in $O(d^3)$ time complexity.  %, where $d$ stands for the number of input features. 
It is worth mentioning that when the number of input features becomes large, these closed-form matrix techniques are usually replaced by iterative ones, such as gradient descent (GD)~\cite{andrychowicz2016learning}. Using GD,  the above complexity reduces to $O(n^2d )$. The learning rate in GD has to be carefully chosen, as it dictates how quick the algorithm is and how fast it converges. Therefore, when comes to input data with large number of features, GS is preferred over OLS.

\subsection{\textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  method}

	\caption{\textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  method.}
	\label{alg:rilsrols}
\end{algorithm}  

\textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  algorithms receives training dataset $D_{tr}$ as input. In addition, it has two control parameters: $penalty_{size}$ and $tolerance_{error}$. The first one quantifies the importance of solution expression complexity in the overall solution quality measure (more on this in Section~\ref{sec:fitness}). The second parameter is related to the expected noise level in data -- higher noise means that tolerance to errors should be higher.
$D_{tr}$ can have very large number of records, so the first step of \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  is to choose a random sample $D_{tr}' \subseteq D_{tr}$ of size $sample_{size}$. Initial the sample size is chosen as $\max(0.01 \cdot n_{tr}, 100)$. The size of sample is later dynamically adjusted through the algorithm's iterations -- when there are no solution improvements for some number of iterations, the sample size is doubled (lines~\ref{line:sampleAdj1}-\ref{line:sampleAdj2} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:rilsrols}).

As previously stated, solution is usually represented by means of a tree. We use a simple solution initialization -- tree root node is set to zero constant. We interchangeably use two solution variables: ($i$) $s$ denotes starting (or working) solution and ($ii$) $bs$ stands for the best solution so far. Solution quality is measured by evaluating the fitness function (more about it in the subsequent Section~\ref{sec:fitness}). Before entering the main loop, the best solution \emph{bs} is set to the initial solution (line~\ref{line:solSet}). 


Main loop iterates as long as none of termination criteria is met: ($i$) maximal running time has been reached; ($ii$) maximal number of fitness calculations has been made; ($iii$) best solution is sufficiently good, 
w.r.t. its $R^2$ and $RMSE$ scores. More precisely, if $R^2$ is sufficiently close to 1 and, at the same time, $RMSE$ is sufficiently close to 0, the algorithm stops prematurely -- this significantly reduces the running times for the majority of tested instances.
The sufficiency is controlled with parameter $tolerance_{error}$ -- smaller value means that $R^2$ and $RMSE$ should be closer to 1 and 0, respectively. 


One of the first steps in the main loop is to generate perturbations near the starting solution $s$ (line~\ref{line:sPert}). 
As the name of this procedure (\texttt{All1Perturbations}) suggests, perturbation step is local -- meaning the closeness of starting solution $s$ and any of perturbations is 1 (we call it 1-perturbation sometimes). The precise way of generating perturbation is described separately, in Section~\ref{sec:pertGen}. 
 

Candidate perturbations are being improved by performing OLS coefficient fitting (procedure \texttt{FitOLS}). This means that coefficients in any of linear combinations of current solution are being set by applying  ordinary least square method, already described in Section~\ref{sec:ols}.   
After this step, perturbations are usually better suited to given sample data $D_{tr}'$. 
Further, these perturbations are sorted w.r.t. $R^2$ metric in the descending order (line~\ref{line:orderR2}). 

Now, the algorithm enters the internal loop -- it iterates over the ordered perturbations and aims to find the one which improves the best solution $bs$. But, before comparing candidate perturbation solution $p$ with $bs$, $p$ is first simplified (line~\ref{line:simp}) after which the local search is performed (line~\ref{line:ls}).
Solution simplification is done in a symbolical fashion by popular \texttt{SymPy} Python package~\cite{sympy}.
Local search tries to find local optima expressions close to the given $p$ -- explained in detail in Section~\ref{sec:ls}.  
Finally, the fitness function value of $p$ is compared to the fitness function value of $bs$. If a new incumbent is found, $bs$ is updated correspondingly and the internal loop that goes across ordered perturbations is immediately terminated (it works in a  \emph{first-improvement} strategy). Otherwise, the next perturbation is probed. 
Note that the probed perturbations are stored in a set denoted by $perturbations_{tried}$. The goal is to avoid checking the same perturbation multiple times (lines \ref{line:avoid1}-\ref{line:avoid2}), i.e. $perturbations_{tried}$ serves as a kind of tabu list, which is known from the Tablu search meta-heuristic, see~\cite{glover1998tabu}.    


If some of $s_{perturbations}$ around starting solution $s$ yielded an improvement, $bs$ becomes the starting solution $s$ in the next iteration of the main loop (line~\ref{line:improved}). 
Otherwise, it makes no sense to set starting solution to $bs$, as nothing changed -- the search is being  \emph{trapped} in a local optimum. In order to avoid this undesired situation, randomness needs to be triggered. First, a set of local perturbations around $bs$ is generated ($start_{candidates}$) in the same manner as before (procedure \texttt{All1Perturbations}). If at least one of these was not previously used as a starting solution ($start_{tried}$), a single perturbation from the $start_{candidates} \setminus start_{tried}$ is randomly picked (line~\ref{line:randPick}). There is a minor chance that $start_{candidates} \setminus start_{tried} = \emptyset$. When that happens, the set of starting solution candidates is equal to perturbations of some randomly selected perturbation of $bs$ (lines \ref{line:pert21}-\ref{line:pert22}) -- which effectively means that the perturbations with distance 2 from $bs$ are used. Indeed, there is almost no chance that these 2-perturbations will have an empty set difference with $start_{tried}$ set of starting solutions. Therefore, more expensive 3-perturbations will not be considered in our algorithm. 

Before returning the final symbolical model, \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  performs the final symbolical simplification and rounding of model coefficients. The latter is sensitive to control parameter $tolerance_{error}$ -- a smaller value means the information loss during rounding is smaller, i.e. a higher number of significant digits is preserved. Note that confidence in the symbolical model is reduced when expected noise in data is higher -- the rule of thumb is: for higher expected noise $tolerance_{error}$ should be higher.

\subsubsection{Fitness function}\label{sec:fitness}

Symbolic regression objective is to determine the expression fitting available data. It is also allowed to obtain some equivalent expression, keeping in mind that there are multiple ways to express some symbolical equation. Although logically sound and intuitive, this objective is not quantifiable during the solution search/training phase, simply because the goal expression is not known at that point as only target values for some of the input features are known. Thus, different numerical metrics are being used in literature to guide the symbolic regression search process. The most popular are the coefficient of determination, also known as $R^2$ and mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). The important aspect of the solution quality might also be the solution expression complexity, which may correspond to the model size of its tree representation. This follows the Occam's razor principle~\cite{costa2020fast}~ that simpler solution  is more likely to be a correct one. 
The search process of \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}  is guided by the non-linear combination of $R^2$, RMSE and solution expression size (complexity) presented in Equation~\ref{eq:fitness}. 
 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:fitness}
	fit(s) = (2-R^2(s)) \cdot (1+RMSE(s)) \cdot (1+penalty_{size} \cdot size(S))
\end{equation}

Since the presented fitness function needs to be minimized, the following conclusions may be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
	\item higher $R^2$ is preferred -- ideally, when $R^2(s)=1$, the effect of term $1+R^2(s)$ is neutralized; %since 1 is neutral for multiplication;
	\item lower RMSE is preferred, ideally, when $RMSE(s)=0$, the whole term $(1+RMSE(s))$ becomes 1;
	\item since $penalty_{size} > 0$, larger expressions tend to have higher fitness (which follows the Occam's razor principle); therefore, we award those solutions with a more simple representation. 
\end{itemize}

The size of expression is calculated by simply counting all nodes in the expression tree -- this includes leaves (variables and constants) and internal nodes (operations). 

\subsubsection{Perturbations}\label{sec:pertGen}

Perturbations allow the algorithm to escape from local optima. As previously described, perturbations are performed in two occasions: ($i$) during the exhaustive examination of neighboring solutions around the starting solution, ($ii$) during selection of the next starting solution, a non-exhaustive case.  
In both cases, the same Algorithm~\ref{alg:pert} is used. 

\begin{algorithm}
	\hspace*{\algorithmicindent} \textbf{Input}: solution $s$ \\
	\hspace*{\algorithmicindent} \textbf{Output}: local perturbations (1-perturbations) of solution $s$ -- $s_{perturbations}$
	\begin{algorithmic}[1] 
		\Procedure{All1Perturbations}{$s$}
		\State $s_{perturbations} \gets \emptyset$ \label{line:pertInit}
		\State $s \gets$ \texttt{NormalizeConstants}($s$)
		\State $s \gets$ \texttt{Simplify}($s$)
		\State $s_{subtrees} \gets$ \texttt{SubTrees}($s$)
		\For{$n \in s_{subtrees}$} \label{line:forSSStart}
		\State $n_{perturbations} \gets$ \texttt{All1PerturbationsAroundNode}($s$, $n$)
		\State $s_{perturbations} \gets s_{perturbations} \cup n_{perturbations}$	
		\EndFor \label{line:forSSEnd}
		\State \Return $s_{perturbations}$
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Generation of all 1-perturbations of a given solution.}
	\label{alg:pert}
\end{algorithm}  

Initially, the set of perturbations $s_{perturbations}$ is empty (line~\ref{line:pertInit} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:pert}).


This is followed by constant normalization during which coefficients that enter multiplication, division, addition or subtraction are set to 1, while those entering the power function are rounded to integer, with exception of square root, which is kept intact. For example, for expression $3.3\cdot(x+45.1\cdot y^{3.2})\cdot 81\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$ the normalized version is $1\cdot (x+1\cdot y^3)\cdot 1\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$. The reason for performing normalization is reducing the search space of possible perturbations thus keeping them within a reasonable size. This reduction is reasonable, since normalization preserves the essential functional form. (Note that coefficients get tuned later during the OLS phase and local search.)


After performing the normalization process, the expression is simplified -- getting compact expression is more likely after normalization than before. The previous expression will take form $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$. The purpose of simplification is removing unnecessary coefficients, but in general it can also be non-trivial symbolic simplification. 


Perturbations are generated by making simple changes on the per-node level of $s$ expression tree.
Depending on the structure of the expression tree (note that expression does not have to have unique tree representation), the set of subtrees of the previous expression $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$ might be $\{(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y}, (x+y^3), x/\sqrt{y}, x, y^3, \sqrt{y}, y\}$. %This set of subtrees is obtained if left subtree of the whole expression is $(x+y^3)$ while the right one is $x/\sqrt{y}$.  
For each subtree $n$, the set of perturbations around $n$ is generated (lines \ref{line:forSSStart}-\ref{line:forSSEnd} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:pert}).   


Algorithm~\ref{alg:pertNode} shows how perturbations around given subtree are generated.

\begin{algorithm}	
	\hspace*{\algorithmicindent} \textbf{Input}: solution $s$, node $n$\\
	\hspace*{\algorithmicindent} \textbf{Output}: 1-perturbations of solution $s$ around node $n$
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Procedure{All1PerturbationsAroundNode}{$s$, $n$}
		\State $n_{perturbations} \gets \emptyset$
		\If{$n = s$} \label{alg:alg4-case-1}
		\State $n_{perturbations} \gets n_{perturbations} \cup$ \texttt{NodeChanges}($n$)
		\EndIf
		\If{$n.arity \geq 1$}\label{alg:alg4-case-2}
		\State $n_{changes} \gets$ \texttt{NodeChanges}($n.left$)
		\For{$nc \in n_{changes}$}
		\State $new \gets$ \texttt{Replace}($s$, $n.left$, $nc$)
		\State $n_{perturbations} \gets n_{perturbations} \cup \{new\}$
		\EndFor
		\EndIf
		\If{$n.arity = 2$}\label{alg:alg4-case-3}
		\State $n_{changes} \gets$ \texttt{NodeChanges}($n.right$)
		\For{$nc \in n_{changes}$}
		\State $new \gets$ \texttt{Replace}($s$, $n.right$, $nc$)
		\State $n_{perturbations} \gets n_{perturbations} \cup \{new\}$
		\EndFor
		\EndIf
		\State \Return $n_{perturbations}$
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Generation of 1-perturbations of a given solution around given node.}
	\label{alg:pertNode}
\end{algorithm}

It can be seen that there are three possibly overlapping cases when performing perturbations on the per-node level. 

\emph{Case 1}. 
Observed node $n$ is the whole tree $s$ (see line ~\ref{alg:alg4-case-1} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:pertNode}). Following on   the previous exemplary expression tree, this means that multiplication node that connects $(x+y^3)$ and $x/\sqrt{y}$ is to be changed. For example, multiplication can be replaced by addition, which forms a 1-perturbation expression (tree) $(x+y^3)+ x/\sqrt{y}$. 


\emph{Case 2}. 
Node $n$ has arity of at least 1 (see line ~\ref{alg:alg4-case-2} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:pertNode}). This means that the left subtree exists, so the left subtree node is to be changed. 
For example, if $n=x+y^3$ the overall perturbation might be $(x/y^3)+x/\sqrt{y}$ (addition is replaced by division). 
Another example would be the case of unary operation, e.g. when $n=\sqrt{y}$. In that case, some of the possible perturbations could be $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{\ln{y}}$ (application of logarithm to left subtree $y$) or $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{x}$ (changing variable $y$ to $x$), etc.

\emph{Case 3}. 
Subtree $ss$ is binary operation, meaning the right subtree must exist (Line ~\ref{alg:alg4-case-3} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:pertNode}). 
The analogous idea is applied as in \emph{Case 2}. 

The algorithm allows the following set of carefully chosen per-node changes: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Any node to any of its subtrees (excluding itself). For example, if $(x+y^3)$ is changed to $x$, the perturbation is $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y} \rightarrow x\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$. 
	\item Variable to another variable or constant to variable. For example,  $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y} \rightarrow (y+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$.
	\item Variable to unary operation applied to that variable. For example,  $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y} \rightarrow (x+y^3)\cdot \ln{x}/\sqrt{y}$.
	\item Unary operation to another unary operation. For example,  $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y} \rightarrow (x+y^3)\cdot x/\sin{y}$.
	\item Binary operation to another binary operation. For example,  $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y} \rightarrow (x+y^3)\cdot (x + \sqrt{y})$. 
	\item Variable or constant enter the binary operation with arbitrary variable. For example,  $(x+y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y} \rightarrow (x+x/y^3)\cdot x/\sqrt{y}$. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Local search}\label{sec:ls}

Perturbations are further improved by means of local search procedure (Algorithm~\ref{alg:ls}). 

\begin{algorithm}
	\hspace*{\algorithmicindent} \textbf{Input}: perturbation $p$, sample training dataset $D_{tr}'$ \\
	\hspace*{\algorithmicindent} \textbf{Output}: local optimum $bp$ in the vicinity of perturbation $p$
	\begin{algorithmic}[1] 
		\Procedure{LocalSearch}{$p$, $D_{tr}'$}
		\State $bp, bp_{fit} \gets p,\ $\texttt{Fitness}$(p,D_{tr}')$ 
		\State $improved \gets true$
		\While{$improved$}
		\State $improved \gets false$
		\State $bp_{candidates} \gets \emptyset$
		\State $bp_{subtrees} \gets $\texttt{SubTrees}($bp$)
		\For{$n \in bp_{subtrees}$}
		\State $n_{candidates} \gets $ \texttt{All1PerturbationsAroundNode}($bp$, $n$)
		\For{$new \in n_{candidates}$}
		\State $new \gets$ \texttt{FitOLS}($new$, $D_{tr}'$)
		\State $new_{fit} \gets$ \texttt{Fitness}($new$, $D_{tr}'$)
		\If{$new_{fit} < bp_{fit}$}
		\State $bp, bp_{fit} \gets new, new_{fit}$
		\State $improved \gets true$
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\EndFor
		\EndWhile
		\State \Return $bp$
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Local search procedure.}
	\label{alg:ls}
\end{algorithm}  

For a given perturbation $p$, local search systematically explores all 1-perturbations around $p$. It relies on the \emph{best-improvement} strategy, meaning that all 1-perturbations (for all subtrees) are considered. Before checking if the candidate solution ($new$) is better that the actual best $bp$, the OLS coefficient fitting (\texttt{FitOLS}) is performed.

\section{Experimental evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}

Our \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm is implemented in Python version 3.x. The experiments concerning our method are performed on a machine xx with xx GHz and a memory limit of xx GB in single-threaded mode.  
The following 14 algorithms are compared to our approach: \textsc{AI-Feynman}, \textsc{GOMEA}, \textsc{Afp-Fe}, \textsc{Itea}, \textsc{Afp}, \textsc{Dsr}, \textsc{Operon}, the \textsc{Gplearn} from python package \textsc{gplearn}~\cite{stephens2016genetic}, \textsc{Sbp-Gp}, \textsc{Eplex}, \textsc{Bsr}, \textsc{Feat}, \textsc{Ffx}, \textsc{Mrgp}. 

For the (14) competitors, the results are exported from \url{https://cavalab.org/srbench/results/}, also reported in~\cite{la2021contemporary}. 
The maximum computation time allowed for each run of \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} is set to 1h, i.e., 3600 seconds; note that the same runtime limit was used for all (14) competitors, see~\cite{la2021contemporary}. 


All (15) competitor algorithms were run ten times per each instance.  


\subsection{Datasets and SRBench}

SRBench is an open-source benchmarking project which merge a large set of diverse benchmark datasets, contemporary SR methods as well as ML methods around a shared model evaluation and an environment for analysis, see~\cite{la2021contemporary}. It brought researchers an easy handled environment to evaluation, comparisons, and analysis of their methods. Among all benchmark sets, we involve two real-world inspired benchmark sets, the ground-truth regression problems, into our computational evaluation: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsc{Feynman} benchmark set, inspired from physics and formulas/models that correspond to various natural laws.  
	It consists of $10^5$  samples, each described in~\cite{udrescu2020ai}. Some exact models (equations) of problem instances from this benchmark are shown in Table~\ref{tab:Feynamn-Eq}.  Among them, 116 regression problem instances are chosen in the experimental evaluation, with accordance to~\cite{la2021contemporary}. 
	
	\begin{table}[!ht]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l}   \hline
			$x = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 \cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}$ \\
			$ \theta_1 = \arcsin(n \sin \theta_2)$ \\
			$E =  \frac{m c^2 }{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$ \\
			$\omega = \frac{1 + \frac{v}{c}}{ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \omega_0$ \\ \hline
			
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Some Feynman equations.}
		\label{tab:Feynamn-Eq}
	\end{table}
	
	
	\item \textsc{Strogatz} benchmark set from~\cite{la2016inference}. 
	Each dataset is represented by a 2-state system of first-order, ordinary differential equations. 
	The aim of each problem is to predict rate of change of the subsequent state w.r.t\  the current two states on which it depends. These equations describes natural processes described by non-linear dynamics  exhibiting chaos.  The equations for some of the datasets that belong to this benchmark are shown in Table~\ref{table:strogatz-ODEs}. These problem instances are downloadable from \url{https://github.com/lacava/ode-strogatz}. In overall, 14 ground-truth models are used to generate the problem instances used in the comparison, see~\cite{la2021contemporary}. 
	
	%table, an instance -- example
	
	\begin{table}
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ll} \\ \hline

		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Some Strogatz ODE problems.}
		\label{table:strogatz-ODEs}
	\end{table}
	
	
\end{itemize}
The above-mentioned benchmark sets may be biased as models which describe physical laws that usually impose   symmetries, periodicity w.r.t. some variables, internal separability on some variables etc. In that way, the search process and the search space can be, in-advance, significantly reduced. Thus, some methods may get significant benefit with this regard, while some others may be in the subordinate situation. 
In order to permit any kind of favoritism in the input data, we generate a set of randomly generated (non-biased) instances, labelled by \textsc{Random}. These instances are generated according the following procedure. \fxnote{Opisati proceduru generisanja instanci + kombinaciju parametara za instance, itd.}


\subsection{Parameter tuning}
The \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} algorithm employs just two parameters that need to be tuned, $penalty_{size}$ and $tolerance_{error}$. The first parameter is fixed to 0.001(?), according to the preliminary experimental evaluation we conducted. The second parameter is tuned by monitoring the two errors the algorithm produced on a randomly chosen training set of xx problem instances; among the following values \{ x, xx, ... \} we chose $tolerance_{error}=?$ for which the largest average $R^2$ and the smallest average RMSE error over all problem instances from the training set are produced. %Note that the training set is chosen randomly with a cardinalty of xx instances. 

\fxnote{ drugi parametar manje vise zavistan od ocekivanog 
	nivoa suma -- ne znam kako obrazloziti njegov tuning (mozda prema greski na trening skupu pa izabrati onaj za koji su R2 i RMSE bolji...). }

\subsection{Comparison with other methods on the   ground--truth benchmark sets}
In this section, we evaluate the performance of \textsc{RILS-ROLS} algorithm and compare it to the 14 other competitors from the literature. The numerical results are reported in terms of the three Tables~\ref{tab:comp_noise0}--\ref{tab:comp_noise001}. The results for the two ground-truth benchmark sets, \textsc{Feynman} and \textsc{Storgatz}, are given w.r.t.\   the following values of the noise levels of 0.0 (no noise), 0.001 (a low-level noise), and 0.01 (a high-level noise), respectively. In details, the white Gaussian noise was added to the target ($y$-axis) values as a fraction of the signal RMS value, also applied in~\cite{la2021contemporary}, i.e. for target noise level $\alpha$, we have
$$ y_{noise} = y + \epsilon, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \alpha \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum {y_i^2}}\right),$$
where $n$ relates to the number of items in the input data.

Each table consists of three blocks. The first block reports the algorithm whose performances are reported (by a row). The second block reports, with two columns,  percentages of the instances where the model which fits to the exact one has been found by respective algorithms on \textsc{Feynman} and \textsc{Strogatz} benchmark set, respectively. The third column of this block provides the overall summary exact percentage of success over all instances from the both benchmark sets. The third block displays the results of the respective algorithm in terms of the $R^2$ score which indicate on  accuracy, i.e. in our cases when the algorithm  at least reached the accuracy ($R^2$ score) of 0.999.  Note that the termination of our algorithm may not always be triggered by reaching an appropriate $R^2$ score of 0.999, but also due to the reached time limit. These results are of interest as when compared to corresponding exact percentage it may point out the existence of an over-fitting. This block consists of three rows that indicate the percentage of instances where respective algorithm is able to reach the desired accuracy (fulfilling the condition $R^2 \geq 0.999$ upon termination) on the both real--world benchmark sets separately, and the overall percentage of success rate (over all considered instances) w.r.t. the same criterion of reaching the desired accuracy.

%Note that when the algorithm terminates with $R^2=1$ and $RMSE=0$, the obtained model and the exact model are always match (but also checked manually). However, in case when the algorithms deliver an error $R^2 \geq 0.999$, but $R^2 \neq 1$, these cases are all  manually checked by comparing weather the produced model match the exact model. 

In short, the exact results, thus the number of instances (in percentages) for which the output of respective algorithm match to the exact model, are displayed in the second block of each of the tables. The numbers of instances (in percentages) for which each algorithms deliver a precise enough model (i.e. satisfying $R^2\geq 0.999$ upon its termination) are displayed in the third block of each of the tables. 

The following conclusions may be drawn from the numerical results: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Concerning the exact percentages in case no noise is utilized in the input data of the instance problems, the best performing algorithm is our \textsc{RILS-ROLS}, able to find the solution that match to the right model on 57.84\% problems instances of the benchmark set \textsc{Feynman}; the same algorithm was even more impressive in solving problem instances from benchmark set \textsc{Strogatz}, being successful on 83.57\% cases. The second best performing  approach is \textsc{AI-Feynman}, successful in solving 55.78\% problem instances from \textsc{Feynman} set, and just 27.14\%  problem instances from benchmark set   \textsc{Strogatz}, respectively. All other approaches are performing much worse, and none of them is able to solve more than 30\% instances of any of the two considered ground-truth benchmark sets. 
	\item   Concerning the exact results in presence of the   noise  level of 0.001, our \textsc{RILS-ROLS} is still performing very well, having found an exact model for 42.08\% cases considering all problem instances from the both ground-truth benchmark sets. The second best approach is \textsc{AI-Feynman} which solved in total 31.89\% problem instances; as  already noticed, this algorithm performs better when applied on the instances from \textsc{Feynman} benchmark set than it is the case of \textsc{Strogatz} benchmark set. Approach  \textsc{AFP-FE} shows to be robust w.r.t. noise so its performances only slightly deteriorate in comparison to the no-noise scenario. This puts it on the third place with overall accuracy of 21.23\%. Other approaches reach   accuracy bellow 20\%. 
	\item  Concerning the exact results when the presence of noise is large, that is the noise level of 0.01,  our \textsc{RILS-ROLS} is still performing robustly, having found an exact model for  34.77\% problem instances considering the both ground-truth benchmark sets. The second best is   \textsc{AFP-FE} reaching 20\% correct solutions. \textsc{AI-Feynman} performances are degraded significantly under this level of noise, so it is ranked only 6th overall, reaching the accuracy of 12.61\%.    
	
	\item When comparing performances of the algorithms in terms of number of instances for which the obtained final model reaches $R^2 \geq 0.999$, in case when no noise is integrated, our \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} is successful with the rate of success of 83.38\% (third place). However, in contrast with the exact model percentages comparisons from above, there are a few methods reaching   better percentages of success than our algorithm: \textsc{MRGP}, and \textsc{Operon}, with 92.69\%, and 86.92\%, respectively. On the other hand, the exact model percentages of these two approaches are rather low (0\% and 16\%, respectively). These two algorithms are therefore more appropriate in scenarios when the underlying (ground-truth) model is unknown, so-called black-box regression. 
	
	\item  In the presence of the noise level of 0.001, our \textsc{RILS-ROLS} method has 78.62\% of a success rate (ranked on the third place).  As before, \textsc{MRGP} and \textsc{Operon} are showing good performances. 
	
	\item   When noise level is 0.01, the situation is almost the same, \textsc{MRGP} and \textsc{Operon} are the best and second best with 88.46\% and 86.54\% accuracy, respectively. \textsc{GP-GOMEA} now reaches third place with 73.46\%, while the proposed \textsc{RILS-ROLS} is fifth with 62.92\% $R^2$ accuracy.
	
	\item Following the above conclusions, our \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} algorithm is more robust than the other competitors, which is confirmed by the produced results w.r.t.\ different levels of noise in the input data. Moreover, it can be considered as new state-of-the-art algorithm when one solves the problems of SR with known ground-truth models.

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:time-avg-exact-noise}, average runtimes of the algorithms on those instance problems from the both ground-truth benchmark sets for which respective exact model has  been found, are compared. The algorithms which obtained an exact percentage of at least 5\% (considering all 1300 runs) are considered as relevant  and therefore included here, while others are omitted.  The runtimes of each algorithm  are averaged w.r.t\  different levels of noise, and presented by a bar plot. Algorithms are labeled on $x$-axis, while respective average runtimes are shown on $y$-axis. Note that $y$-axis is logarithmically scaled. The following conclusions are drawn from here.

\begin{itemize}
	\item When considering the instance problems with no noise is included, the lowest average runtime  is reported for \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} algorithm (228$s$). A slightly worse runtime is obtained by \textsc{Dsr} algorithm (232$s$).  However, note that the exact percentage of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} is far better from \textsc{Dsr} (60.62\% vs. 19.71\%). 	All remaining approaches deliver an order of magnitude larger average runtimes than that of the \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} method. 
	\item  When considering the instance problems with the noise level of 0.001,    the lowest average runtime  is again delivered by \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} algorithm (108$s$). The second best average runtime is produced by \textsc{Dsr}, but this time significantly larger (622$s$) from the former algorithm. 
	\item When considering the instance problems with the noise level of 0.01, a similar conclusion may be drawn as that from the previous point. 
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Statistical evaluation}

In order to check the statistical significance of the results w.r.t.\ obtained exact models and their differences between the competitor approaches, we employed the statistical methodology comparing the results of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} to 14 other approaches over all problem instances from the both ground-truth benchmark sets, \textsc{Feynman} and \textsc{Strogatz}. Note that an indicator random variable is involved per each run of the algorithms. Thus, the score that comes into the statistical observation is an indicator (0 or 1) indicating weather or not an algorithm was able to return the exact model per each run. More precisely, we involved 1300 results into our statistical evaluation for each of the algorithms. Note that  results of some of the 14 competitors are not known from \url{https://cavalab.org/srbench/results/} due to some unknown reasons (most likely algorithm is terminated running out of memory or due to the chosen  value of an internal parameter). For these runs, we simply count a 0 for the score.   

Initially, Friedman’s test was separately executed for all competitor approaches.      In those cases in which the null hypothesis $H_0$ was rejected ($H_0$ states that there are no statistical differences between the obtained results of all competitors) pairwise comparisons are further performed by using the Nemenyi post-hoc test~\cite{pohlert2014pairwise}. The outcome is represented by means of critical difference (CD) plots. In each CD plot, the (15) competitor approaches are placed on the horizontal axis according to their average ranking. Thereafter, the CD score is computed for a significance level of 0.05. If the difference is small enough, meaning that no statistical difference is detected, a horizontal bar linking statistically equal approaches is drawn.   Three (one for each level of noise) CD plots are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cd-plots-exact-pcts} per each level of noise. The following conclusions may be drawn from there.

\begin{itemize}
	\item  Concerning the instance problems where no noise is included, \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} method returns the best average ranking in terms of the number of obtained exact models.  The second best average ranking is achieved by \textsc{AI-Feynman} algorithm. There is  statistically significant difference between these two approaches w.r.t.\ number of found exact models. The third best approach is \textsc{Apf-Fe},  which is far behind \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} w.r.t.\ delivered average ranking.  
	\item    Concerning the instance problems with the included  level of noise of 0.001, \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} method again obtains the best average ranking in terms of the found exact models.   The second best ranking is obtained by \textsc{AI-Feynman} algorithm. There is again a statistically significant difference between the results obtained by these two approaches. The third best approach is \textsc{Afp-Fe} which performs statistically worse than \textsc{AI-Feynman} approach.  
	\item  Concerning the instance problems with the included noise level of  0.01, again, \textsc{RILS-ROLS} method produces the best average ranking according to positively evaluated runs, i.e. the runs with obtained exact models; the second best approach w.r.t.\ average ranking is \textsc{Afp-Fe}, followed by \textsc{Dsr}, and \textsc{Afp}. These latter three approaches perform statistically equal, but significantly worse than \text{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} method. 	The fourth best approach according to delivered average ranking is \textsc{AI-Feynman} which is on pair with \textsc{gplearn}. Note that the average ranking of \textsc{AI-Feynman} method declines by increasing  the level of noise in the input data. Thus, despite being efficient on no-noisy data, it seems that \textsc{AI-Feynman} is very sensitive to the level of noise increase, which is not that dramatically conspicuous with our \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} method.

\subsection{Scalability of \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} algorithm}\label{sec:scalability-rils-rols}

In this section we study the scalability of our method in terms of the size of  instance problems and  the presence of different noise level in the input data. 

First, we divide our benchmark sets into three parts as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Small--sized instances}: all instances from \textsc{Random} benchmark whose the corresponding exact models tree representations have from 3 to 7 nodes belong to this sub-set.
	\item \textit{Middle--sized instances}:  all instances from \textsc{Random} benchmark whose the corresponding exact models tree representations have from 8 to 11 nodes belong to this sub-set.
	\item \textit{Large--sized instances}: all instances from \textsc{Random} benchmark whose the corresponding exact models tree representations have from 12 to 15 nodes belong to this sub-set. 
\end{itemize}

The results are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:compExact_noise_size}, grouped with accordance to the (three) formed sub-groups ($x$-axis); for each of them the exact percentage rate of success of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm is shown ($y$-axis). The following conclusions may be drawn from here:

\begin{itemize}
	\item   As expected, the exact percentage success rate is the highest for the small--sized instance problems; it is sightly bellow 90\% for the no-noisy data. For noisy data, the success rate of the algorithm gets decreased as the level of noise increases. For example, on the small-sized problem instances with the noise level  of 0.0001, and 0.01, the exact percentage of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} is still reasonably high, at about 55\%~ and 34 \%, respectively. 
	\item For the middle-sized instance problems, the exact percentage rate is slightly bellow 50\%. It also decreases by increasing the level of noise in the target data; for the highest level of noise (of 0.01), the success rate of \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS} method is just about 6\%. 
	\item For the large-sized instance problems with no noise is utilized, the exact percentage of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm is at about 25\%, which means that the increase in the size of exact models affects the algorithm's performance, but within the expected range.  
	
	\item From the above, we can conclude that the size of exact models (solutions) and the increase of the noise level both contribute to overall performance of our \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} method. The exact percentage rate of the algorithm seems decreasing linearly  in the (exact) model size, regardless of the noise level values.
	
	\item Concerning the high--accuracy percentages delivered by \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm -- that is the percentage of problem instances for which the algorithm's termination yielded a model with $R^2 \geq 0.999$ -- for the small--sized problem instances with no noise is recorded, it is almost at the perfect score (i.e. $\approx$100\%). In the presence of a low noise level (equals to 0.001), the percentages of instance problems with the high--accuracy is still high, at about 95\%. In case when the high level of noise (equals to 0.01) is presented in the input data, these percentages stagnate, but still are at a respectable 66\%. %small-sized instances it reaches a high--precision of $R^2=0.999$ upon termination.   
	As we pointed out already, a half of these math to the respectable exact models.
	
	\item Concerning the high--accuracy percentage of the \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm on the middle-sized instance problems when the input data are free of the noise, it is obtained on 65\% cases.    The noisy the data are, the accuracy percentages of the algorithm, as expected, drop off; however, not so dramatically. For the level of noise of 0.01, the high--accuracy of the final solution is reported on $\approx$30\% cases.
	
	\item Concerning the high--accuracy percentages of the \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm on the large-sized instance problems with no noise, it gets 60\%. Not so surprisingly, the hardest case to obtain the desired high--accuracy (that is, ensuring $R^2\geq 0.999$ for the outcome  upon termination) is in the presence of a high level of noise (of 0.01), where the algorithm was successful on about 20\% of the considered large--sized instance problems.

In this paragraph we investigate the  scalability of our \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm in terms of the number of variables and sizes of corresponding exact models of the problem instances varying levels of noise. There is three bar plots shown per each level of noise.  These are shown by Figures~\ref{fig:compExact_noise_varcnt} and~\ref{fig:compExact_noise_varsizes}. The instances are grouped according to the different variable count/size of respective exact models ($x$-axis). For each group, the exact percentages of success rate of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm on the instance group is shown ($y$-axis).

The following conclusions can be drawn from Figure~\ref{fig:compExact_noise_varcnt}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The exact percentage rate of \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm  slightly decrease as the expected number of variables gets larger when no noise is presented in the data.
	\item The exact percentages drop off with the presence of a larger noise level. Thus, the higher the noise level, the smaller the exact percentages are.
	\item Interestingly, in the presence of noise, the highest exact percentages are not obtained on the problem instances whose exact models consists of a single variable, but two or three. We argue it by the fact that the early phase of the algorithm will more likely try to include additional variables in the solution at the cost of increasing the model accuracy to ensure improving the fitness value over iterations. In the presence of the zero noise, OLS method will more likely find a smaller model (on $\approx$ 50\% cases) with a high accuracy that fits to the (no-noisy) input data than the case of noisy data. When the data is noisy, the decision of adding more variables at the beginning is likely to be forced than just dealing with short-size solutions. By the algorithm's progression, it gets harder improving the best fitness value by adding variables, and other operations are more frequently involved than in previous iterations. %This conclusion also correlates to the shape of fitness function given by Equation~(\ref{eq:fitness}) where the first two product terms there are already small (close to 1).      \fxnote{TODO: need to be further expanded...}

The  following conclusions may be drawn from Figure~\ref{fig:compExact_noise_varsizes}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The exact percentages are decreased with the increase of size of exact models, in case of any level of noise utilized on the target values.  %within the input data.
	\item The highest exact percentages, which are higher than 70\%, are noticed for the small-sized problem instances  (the size ranges from 3 to 7) exact models. However, for the same sizes, for noisy data, these percentages are significantly lower; for example, in case of models of size 7 and the level of noise of 0.001 and 0.01, the exact percentages obtained are 20\% and 10\%, respectively. 
	
	\item   For the problem instances with a largest size of (exact) models for no noisy data, exact percentages are never lower than 20\%. The opposite holds for noisy data.

When one concerns of runtime analysis of the \textsc{RILS}--\textsc{ROLS} algorithm on the \textsc{Random} benchmark set w.r.t\ number of variables, the results are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:runtime_rils_rols}. The instances are grouped w.r.t.\ number of variables included into corresponding exact model ($x$-axis). The following conclusions may be drawn from there.  

\begin{itemize}
	\item As one could expect, average runtime is getting increased with the increase of the number of variables in exact models. 
	\item Note that the average runtime in case of the instances whose exact models have the largest number of variables (5) is just about 200$s$.
	\item The two above-mentioned points indicate efficacy of our method especially in case of expected exact models of a small and middle sizes with small--to--middle levels of noise included in the input data. In these cases, the algorithm is able to deliver the reasonable exact percentages, which are always larger than 50\%. Note that models which have more compact representations (thus, small in their size) are desirable in many areas of natural sciences due to easier interpret-ability more than models represented by a more complex expression.

\section{Conclusions and future work}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we dealt with solving the well--known Symbolic regression (SR)  problem. SR problem is a generalization of more interdisciplinary known problems of linear and logistic regression.    
We proposed a meta-heuristic approach, called \textsc{RILS}-\textsc{ROLS}. Our approach is built upon the Iterated local search (ILS) scheme. The first crucial concept within this scheme is utilizing the ordinary least square method to efficiently determine internal coefficients that are the best fitting to the candidate solution. Thus, the search process is primarily focused on considering already promising solutions in the continuous part of the search space rather than applying enhanced heuristics to search for those coefficients. Another key aspect is the utilization of a carefully constructed fitness function in the search, which appeared as a combination of three important scores: RMSE, $R^2$  scores and the size of the model (solution).  Last but not least, a carefully constructed local search is applied systematically exploring solutions obtained as 1--perturbations of the considered solution.  1--perturbations of a solution are based on applying the six per-node change operations on the solution's tree representation. 

\textsc{RILS-ROLS} method is compared to the 14 other competitor algorithms from the literature on the two ground truth benchmark sets from literature, namely \textsc{Feynman} and \textsc{Strogatz}.  Additionally, we introduced a non-biased benchmark set of randomly generated instances, labelled by \textsc{Random}.  The experimental evaluation confirmed the efficiency of our method which produced the best average ranking results in terms of exact percentage when compared to all other competitors on the two ground-truth benchmarks in the presence of all three different levels of noise in the input data. In all cases, new best exact percentages are obtained using \textsc{RILS-ROLS} method.   More in details,
our algorithm was able to obtain the right model on 60.62\%, 42.08\%, and 34.77\% problem instances in the presence of the noise level of 0.0, 0.001, and 0.01, respectively. Just for the shake of comparisons, the second best approach \textsc{AI-Feynman}, when the noise level of 0.0 and 0.001 is included, obtained an exact percentage rate of 52.65\%, and 31.89\%, respectively. In case of the highest noise level, the second best approach was \textsc{Afp-Fe}, obtaining an exact percentage rate of 20\%. Additionally, the scalability and robustness of this method are checked and confirmed on the unbiased \textsc{Random} benchmark set in terms of a few different criteria such as the size of the model, the number of variables included in exact models, and obtained average runtimes. 

In future work, one could think of constructing a hybrid of \textsc{RILS-ROLS} method with some other meta-heuristics to further boost the quality of the obtained results. For example, replacing ILS scheme of \textsc{RILS-RILS} with a more general Variable neighbourhood search (VNS) scheme is a reasonable option to give it a try. VNS   utilizes a more stronger and systematic system of solutions diversification and thus escaping from local optima could be much easier.  Additionally, as proof of the efficiency and benefits of our algorithm, this tool could be applied to solving problems from various problem domains out of the area of computer science, for example from physics or chemistry, to help for setting up hypotheses or to obtain valuable insights on experimental evaluations.
